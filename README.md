Hi! This is my final project for the OOP Python program.
I have created a Fighting game between a Hero and Enemies.
You have to click Enter to proceed the fighting.
If your weapon breaks, you have a choice to either sacrifice 
10 HP and get a new random weapon, or you can continue with your
HP and fight with Fists.
This game lasts until the Hero dies. You can fight as many Enemies,
as you can, until your health bar goes 0.
At the end, the photo of the fighting scene will pop up and
you will have your results stored in "game_results.txt"
Thank you for all your lessons and hope you have a great day!
